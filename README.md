This is a small page to allow a visitor to easily choose a city for the EqualStreetNames project.
To do so it fetches the [`cities.json`](https://github.com/EqualStreetNames/module-global/blob/master/cities.json) file and parses it.
A demo can be viewed on [equalstreetnames.eu](https://equalstreetnames.eu/)
